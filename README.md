# Casambi Bluetooth Revamped

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1186445089317326888)](https://discord.gg/jgZVugfx)

An enhanced fork of the [original Casambi Bluetooth integration](https://github.com/lkempf/casambi-bt-hass) by [@lkempf](https://github.com/lkempf), with additional features for better switch and relay support.

> ⚠️ **DEVELOPMENT WARNING**: This repository is used as a development environment. Things might break at any moment. It's recommended to wait at least 1 day after a new release before updating to ensure stability. All stable changes will be merged back to the original repository.
> 
> **When to use this fork**: Use this version if you need Classic firmware support, want to use Casambi switches in Home Assistant (usable but still being improved), or need relay support. Otherwise, stick with the original integration.

## What's Enhanced

- **Classic protocol support** - Lighting fixtures on Classic (legacy) Casambi firmware networks: on/off, dimming, and live state sync from the Casambi app. More testers welcome!
- **Switch event support** - Physical switch button press/hold/release events (wired + wireless)
- **Automation blueprints** - Ready-to-use blueprints for button automations
- **Fixed relay status** - Properly reports the status of relay units (also merged to the original integration)
- **Based on casambi-bt-revamped** - Uses an enhanced version of the underlying library (protocol-level INVOCATION parsing)

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### HACS (Recommended)
1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Search for "Casambi Bluetooth Revamped" and install
3. Restart Home Assistant

#### Manual
1. Copy the `custom_components/casambi_bt` folder to your `config/custom_components/`
2. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
2. Search for "Casambi Bluetooth"
3. Enter your network password from the Casambi app

## Features

### 📱 Switch Button Events
Physical switches fire events for automations:
- Button press, hold, and release detection
- Hold/release-after-hold are emitted when the device/firmware sends them (no timer-based synthesis)
- Support for short/long press actions

[**→ Detailed Switch Event Documentation**](docs/SWITCH_EVENTS.md)

### 🎯 Automation Blueprints
Import ready-to-use blueprints with one click:

[![Toggle and Dim](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frankjie%2Fcasambi-bt-hass%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcasambi_bt%2Fbutton_toggle_and_dim.yaml) **Toggle and Dim** - All-in-one light control (short press = toggle, hold = dim)

[![Button Actions](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frankjie%2Fcasambi-bt-hass%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcasambi_bt%2Fbutton_short_long_press.yaml) **Button Actions** - Versatile automation for any button event

[![Cover Control](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frankjie%2Fcasambi-bt-hass%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcasambi_bt%2Fbutton_cover_control.yaml) **Cover Control** - Smart blind/cover control (press = open/close/stop, hold = continuous)

[**→ Blueprint Documentation & Examples**](docs/BLUEPRINTS.md)

### 💡 Supported Devices
- Lights (dimmer, color, temperature, on/off)
- Light groups
- Scenes
- Switches (as events, not entities)
- Relays

Classic (legacy) firmware notes:
- Discovery includes both EVO (`FE4D`) and Classic (`CA5A`) advertisements.
- On/off, dimming, and bidirectional state sync are working for lighting fixtures.
- Changes made in the Casambi app are reflected in HA in real time.
- More testers welcome — if you have a Classic network, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rankjie/casambi-bt-hass/issues) with your experience.

## Network Setup

**Important**: Your Casambi network must be configured correctly:
1. Enable "Bluetooth control" in the Casambi app
2. Set a network password
3. See the [original setup guide](https://github.com/lkempf/casambi-bt#casambi-network-setup) for details

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    CasambiBt: debug
    custom_components.casambi_bt: debug
```

For issues, please include:
- Debug logs (sanitize sensitive data)
- Your network configuration
- Device types you're trying to control
